# BinarySearch
BINARY SEARCH: PYTHON
Iterative Binary Search
Anything recursive can be written iteratively.

As a final exercise, we’ll implement the binary search algorithm using iteration.

Our strategy remains largely the same as the recursive approach which used pointers.

Instead of recursive calls, we’ll substitute a while loop.

Instructions
1.
Complete the binary_search() skeleton.

You’ll need to:

Fill in the condition for the while loop
Calculate the middle index using pointers
Set the left_pointer when appropriate
Set the right_pointer when appropriate
